# Predicting-Dengue-Cases-Using-XGBoost-and-Prophet

Dengue has been a recurring epidemic in the Philippines since 1954. It is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, primarily during the rainy season from June to February. In 2025, the Philippines is experiencing a significant dengue outbreak, with cases rising sharply across the country, including in Quezon City. The local government has declared a dengue outbreak and implemented protective measures to curb the transmission rate. Previous efforts have attempted to forecast dengue outbreaks to support public health preparedness. This study aims to develop predictive models for weekly dengue cases, specifically XGBoost and Prophet, to forecast cases in Quezon City, Philippines, using parameters such as previous dengue cases, relative humidity, temperature (maximum and minimum), rainfall amount, wind speed, and wind direction.
